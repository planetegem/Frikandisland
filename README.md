This depository will contain the source code for my next game, Frikandisland.

Goals:
- The intention is for Frikandisland to become a survival game with very similar mechanics as Forager. The player will start on a small portion of the map, where resources will spawn randomly. The player needs to forage these resources to progress.
- By progressing in the game, new parts of the map are unlocked. 
- The map is procedurally generated: no 2 players will have the same map.
- The map consists of biomes which are impacted by the player's behavior. For example: grasslands become desert if they are overfarmed.
- The game is played from an isometric perspective, but uses true 3D. For this, the MonoGame library is used.


Parts:
- Aether.Extras adds support for animated models
- EntityFactory is a continuation of this project: https://github.com/planetegem/MonoGame3DPlayground. This is where I can test movement mechanics, 3D models & animations, and their hitboxes.
